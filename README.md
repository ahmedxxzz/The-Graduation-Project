## 📖 About The Project

  

This project provides a complete, end-to-end solution for the automated classification of dog femur fractures. By leveraging computer vision and deep learning, it aims to assist veterinary professionals in diagnosing fracture types from X-ray images with high accuracy. The system processes raw radiographs, isolates the femur, and uses a suite of powerful Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to deliver a fast and reliable classification.

  

This repository contains all the necessary code, from data preprocessing and model training to a ready-to-use desktop application for real-time predictions.

## ⚙️ Project Pipeline

  

The project follows a systematic pipeline to ensure robust and reproducible results.

  

**Raw X-ray → Segmentation → Augmentation → Balancing → Model Training → Prediction**

  

1.  **Data Preprocessing & Segmentation (`01-Segmentation/`)**

    The initial step processes raw X-ray images. A segmentation algorithm is applied to automatically detect and crop the region of interest (the femur bone), reducing noise and focusing the models on relevant features.

  

2.  **Data Augmentation (`02-Augmentation/`)**

    To create a more robust training set and prevent overfitting, various data augmentation techniques (e.g., rotation, flipping, zooming) are applied to the segmented images.

  

3.  **Data Balancing (`03-Data-Balancing/`)**

    The dataset is carefully balanced to ensure an equal number of samples for both the "Oblique" and "Overriding" fracture classes. This is critical for training an unbiased model.

  

4.  **Model Training & Evaluation (`04-Modeling/`)**

    This core stage involves training multiple CNN architectures using both feature extraction and fine-tuning methods. Each model's performance is rigorously evaluated using standard classification metrics.
